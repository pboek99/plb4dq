I went through all the examples you provided and did some research about them to see which one best suited me or sounded interesting. uPort and OpenID connect sounded a bit more complicated. I decided to go with OAuth, mainly because there are a lot of videos and articles that are very beneficial to use and figure it out. I tried many different videos to help try to use it but in the end could not completly get to the end. I got closest using the passporty library but couldnt figure out the ends of it. I ran into many obstacles mainly not being able to get it to run but I also everything had many things to read and not too clear on how to use it all. I went back to using some javascript i learned in a previous class to help me a bit but many resources i found did not exaplin it in javascript or the thigns i learned previously.
