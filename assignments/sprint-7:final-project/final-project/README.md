# Payton Boekhout - plb4dq - Finished Google Login - Set up is same as previous sprint

So my main portion of my google log in works but I had issues changing it to parts of my portfolio and adding more data. The main google log in will show you somthing simple like a screenshot but I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to add more data and read more from the internet.






Flask, Flask-Login, Login with Google, App setup as Google Client

Installation with Pipenv:

```
pipenv install
```

Installation without Pipenv:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Initalize the database by running app.py for the first time:

```
python app.py
```

Should see "Initialized the database."

Run the command again to start the Flask web server locally:

```
python app.py
```
