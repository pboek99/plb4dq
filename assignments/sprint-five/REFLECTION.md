After following the steps in your video and having some fun and testing different things out on my own I got my google OAUth login to work and displays the profile picture. I tried testing to have it collect some information and display some other things but overall I couldn't get those things to work and stay. But the main function of the login to get them to login and logout with a screen describing it worked was my main goal, which I was able to accoplish which you can test on my system.
Some sites I visited:

https://oauth.net/articles/authentication/
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.7.RELEASE/reference/html/oauth2login-advanced.html

Some thigns I hope to have functioning with my SSO as i cntinue to work on it is I want to collect and/or display more data. While showing the profile picture is progress I want to get more out of it and allow the user to have more options than just looking at their picture.
