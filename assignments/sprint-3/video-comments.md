The evolution call was talking about metrics and a major one that was talked about was the metric about checking to see if 
people are inactive and still using the project, or even just losing intrest. It was nice too see how the team went through the
process of analyzing the metric and deciding if anything needed to be changed. They talked about how it will be implementing 
and if they results will actual be beneficial enough. Its nice to see the whole process from start to end and how it gets
to the final place. 


I issued a pull request of my metric defenition to the main working group repository.
