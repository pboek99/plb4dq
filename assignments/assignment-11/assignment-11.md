I plan to attend the Evolution Working Group on April 8th at 9am, and will sit in on that zoom call.

Reflections of Podcast:

The first part of the podcast was very interesting just getting to know the people on the podcast and hear their stories. They all came from different places and I enjoyed hearing about how they came involved with the CHAOSS project and open source software as a whole. It is nice to know that people come from all over that coem involved with open source whihc brings all sorts of different ideas and perspectives which will make CHAOSS and open source better. I feel like they explained the metrics very well and how it was all formed and how valuable they are to the project and making everything run smoothly. It was also very nice to hear about the different groups and it fairly simple to understand and anyone can understand and get involved. There are people with PHD and people without and all people play a part in improving open source software. You dont need to be an expert level coder or anything just good ideas talking to others is just as beneficial if not more beneficial.
